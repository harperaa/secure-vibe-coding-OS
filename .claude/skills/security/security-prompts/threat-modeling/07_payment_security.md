# Payment Security Assessment (Clerk Billing + Stripe)

**Category**: Threat Modeling  
**When to Use**: If using Clerk Billing + Stripe for payments  
**Module**: 3.5  
**Time to Implement**: 30 minutes

## Security Coverage

- ‚úÖ PCI-DSS concepts compliance
- ‚úÖ No card data on server
- ‚úÖ Webhook security
- ‚úÖ Stripe integration security
- ‚úÖ Common pitfalls avoided

## The Prompt

```
Assess the security of my payment implementation using Clerk Billing and Stripe.

**Payment Implementation Context**:
- Payment Provider: Clerk Billing + Stripe
- Features: [e.g., subscriptions, one-time payments, usage-based billing]
- Architecture: Secure Vibe Coding OS
- Reference: @docs/security/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md

**PCI-DSS Concepts Assessment**:

Important: You are NOT handling credit cards directly (Stripe does), so full PCI-DSS compliance is not required. However, verify these security concepts:

**1. Card Data Handling**:
Critical Questions:
- Does any cardholder data ever touch my server? [MUST BE NO]
- Are payment forms hosted by Stripe Checkout? [MUST BE YES]
- Is card data collected client-side and sent directly to Stripe? [MUST BE YES]
- Do server logs ever contain card numbers? [MUST BE NO]
- Is card data ever stored in my database? [MUST BE NO]

**2. Webhook Security**:
Stripe sends webhooks for payment events. Verify:
- Are webhook signatures validated using Stripe's library?
- Are webhook endpoints protected from replay attacks?
- Is webhook processing idempotent (handle duplicates)?
- Are webhook secrets stored securely (env variables)?
- Are failed webhooks logged and alerted?

**3. HTTPS Everywhere**:
- Is HTTPS enforced on all pages?
- Are cookies Secure and HttpOnly?
- Is HSTS header present?
- Are API calls to Stripe over HTTPS?

**4. Subscription Security**:
- Can users only cancel their own subscriptions?
- Are subscription changes authorized?
- Are subscription status checks server-side?
- Is subscription data in sync with Stripe?

**5. API Key Security**:
- Are Stripe API keys in environment variables?
- Are publishable and secret keys used correctly?
- Are test and live keys separated?
- Are keys never exposed client-side (except publishable key)?
- Is key rotation planned?

**6. Error Handling**:
- Do payment errors leak sensitive information?
- Are Stripe error messages sanitized for users?
- Are payment failures logged securely?
- Are declined cards handled gracefully?

**7. Access Control**:
- Can users only access their own payment history?
- Are admin payment operations logged?
- Is payment data properly authorized?

**Common Payment Implementation Pitfalls**:

Check for these mistakes:
- ‚ùå Collecting card data on your own forms
- ‚ùå Storing CVV codes (NEVER allowed)
- ‚ùå Not validating webhook signatures
- ‚ùå Exposing secret API keys client-side
- ‚ùå Using test keys in production
- ‚ùå Not handling webhook retries
- ‚ùå Trusting client-side payment status
- ‚ùå Missing HTTPS on payment pages
- ‚ùå Logging card numbers
- ‚ùå No idempotency for webhooks

**Security Checklist**:

Verify each item:
- [ ] NO card data touches our server
- [ ] All payment forms use Stripe Checkout or Elements
- [ ] Webhook signatures validated
- [ ] HTTPS enforced everywhere
- [ ] API keys in environment variables
- [ ] Publishable key used client-side only
- [ ] Secret key used server-side only
- [ ] Webhook processing is idempotent
- [ ] Failed payments logged
- [ ] Users can only access own payment data
- [ ] Payment errors don't leak info
- [ ] Subscription changes authorized
- [ ] Test keys not in production
- [ ] Key rotation process exists

**Assessment Output**:

Provide:
1. Security Score (0-100)
2. Critical Issues (must fix before launch)
3. High Priority Issues (fix soon)
4. Medium Priority Issues (improve over time)
5. Best Practices Followed
6. Recommendations

Generate complete payment security assessment.

[Your Clerk Billing integration code]
[Your webhook handlers]
```

## Red Flags

**Immediate Action Required**:
- üö® Card data on your server
- üö® Unvalidated webhooks
- üö® Secret keys exposed
- üö® No HTTPS on payment pages

## Deliverables

- [ ] Payment security assessment complete
- [ ] PCI-DSS concepts verified
- [ ] Webhook security confirmed
- [ ] Critical issues identified
- [ ] Recommendations provided
- [ ] Save to: `docs/security/PAYMENT_SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md`

## Best Practices

**Do**:
- ‚úÖ Use Stripe Checkout (easiest, most secure)
- ‚úÖ Validate all webhook signatures
- ‚úÖ Handle webhook retries with idempotency
- ‚úÖ Store only Stripe IDs, not card data
- ‚úÖ Use different keys for test and production
- ‚úÖ Log payment events for debugging

**Don't**:
- ‚ùå Touch card data ever
- ‚ùå Store CVV codes (illegal)
- ‚ùå Trust client-side payment status
- ‚ùå Use test keys in production
- ‚ùå Expose secret keys client-side
- ‚ùå Log sensitive payment details

## Testing Payment Security

```bash
# Test webhook signature validation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "stripe-signature: fake_signature" \
  -d '{"type": "payment_intent.succeeded"}'
# Expected: 400 Bad Request (invalid signature)

# Test with valid signature (use Stripe CLI)
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
# Expected: 200 OK, webhook processed
```
