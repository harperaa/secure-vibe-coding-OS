# Setup Guide for secure-claude-skills Package

This guide walks you through setting up the GitHub repository, npm package, and integrating it with your main project using git subtree.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository settings:
   - **Name**: `secure-claude-skills`
   - **Description**: "Defense-in-depth security skills for Claude Code - CSRF protection, rate limiting, input validation, and more"
   - **Visibility**: Public (so others can use it)
   - **Initialize**: Leave all checkboxes UNCHECKED (we have files already)

3. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Package to GitHub

You have the package ready at `/Users/allenharper/Dropbox/code/secure-claude-skills-package/`

```bash
# Navigate to the package directory
cd /Users/allenharper/Dropbox/code/secure-claude-skills-package

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Secure Claude Skills package with CLI installer

- Defense-in-depth security skills for Claude Code
- 10 security skills covering OWASP Top 10
- CLI installer with 3 installation modes (copy, subtree, submodule)
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Ready for npm publishing"

# Add GitHub as remote (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Set Up npm Package

### 3.1 Verify package.json

The package.json is already configured. Verify these fields are correct:

```json
{
  "name": "secure-claude-skills",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Allen Harper",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git"
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Make CLI executable

```bash
chmod +x bin/cli.js
```

### 3.3 Test package locally

```bash
# Install dependencies (none currently, but good to verify)
npm install

# Test CLI locally
node bin/cli.js --help
```

You should see the help output with installation instructions.

### 3.4 Create npm account (if you don't have one)

```bash
npm login
# Enter your npm credentials
```

If you don't have an npm account:
1. Go to https://www.npmjs.com/signup
2. Create account
3. Verify email
4. Run `npm login`

### 3.5 Publish to npm

```bash
# Dry run to see what will be published
npm publish --dry-run

# If everything looks good, publish
npm publish

# You should see:
# + secure-claude-skills@1.0.0
```

**Note**: npm package names must be unique. If `secure-claude-skills` is taken, you might need to:
- Use a scoped package: `@harperaa/secure-claude-skills`
- Choose different name: `secure-claude-code-skills`

To publish scoped package:
```bash
# Update package.json name to "@harperaa/secure-claude-skills"
npm publish --access public
```

## Step 4: Integrate with Main Project Using Subtree

Now we'll set up git subtree in your main project (`secure-vibe-coding-OS`).

### 4.1 Verify main repo structure

Your main repo has already been restructured:
```
.claude/
â””â”€â”€ skills/
    â””â”€â”€ security/
        â”œâ”€â”€ security-overview/
        â”œâ”€â”€ csrf-protection/
        â””â”€â”€ ... (all skills)
```

### 4.2 Remove security folder (temporarily)

We need to remove the local security folder so subtree can add it:

```bash
cd /Users/allenharper/Dropbox/code/secure-vibe-coding-OS

# Make sure you're on main branch with no uncommitted changes
git status

# If you have uncommitted changes, commit them first
git add .
git commit -m "Restructure skills to .claude/skills/security/"

# Remove the security directory (don't worry, it's backed up in the package repo)
rm -rf .claude/skills/security

# Commit the removal
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for subtree: Remove security skills directory"
```

### 4.3 Add subtree

```bash
# Add the skills repo as a subtree
git subtree add --prefix=.claude/skills/security \
  https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git main --squash

# This creates a commit that adds all skills to .claude/skills/security/
```

**What happened:**
- Git pulled all files from `secure-claude-skills` repo
- Placed them in `.claude/skills/security/` directory
- Created a merge commit linking the subtree

### 4.4 Verify subtree setup

```bash
# Check that skills are back
ls .claude/skills/security/

# You should see:
# auth-security/
# csrf-protection/
# dependency-security/
# ... etc
```

### 4.5 Push changes

```bash
git push origin main
```

## Step 5: Verify Everything Works

### 5.1 Test npm installation (in a test directory)

```bash
# Create a test Next.js project
cd /tmp
npx create-next-app test-skills-install
cd test-skills-install

# Test your package
npx secure-claude-skills init

# Check installation
ls .claude/skills/security/

# You should see all skills installed!
```

### 5.2 Test subtree updates (in main repo)

Make a small change to test the update workflow:

```bash
# Go to package repo
cd /Users/allenharper/Dropbox/code/secure-claude-skills-package

# Make a small change (e.g., update README)
echo "Test update" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test: Add update note to README"
git push

# Go to main repo
cd /Users/allenharper/Dropbox/code/secure-vibe-coding-OS

# Pull updates from subtree
git subtree pull --prefix=.claude/skills/security \
  https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git main --squash

# You should see the README change reflected in .claude/skills/security/README.md
```

## Step 6: Update Main Project README

Add a note to your main project README about the skills being managed as a separate package:

```markdown
## Security Skills

Security architecture is implemented through specialized Claude Code skills managed as a separate package:

- **Package**: [secure-claude-skills](https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills)
- **npm**: `npx secure-claude-skills init`
- **Location**: `.claude/skills/security/` (managed as git subtree)

The skills are synchronized with the main package using git subtree. To update:

\`\`\`bash
git subtree pull --prefix=.claude/skills/security \\
  https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git main --squash
\`\`\`
```

## Step 7: Optional - Add Convenience Script

Create a script to make subtree updates easier:

```bash
# In main repo root
cat > scripts/update-security-skills.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "Updating security skills from secure-claude-skills repo..."
git subtree pull --prefix=.claude/skills/security \
  https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git main --squash
echo "âœ… Security skills updated!"
EOF

chmod +x scripts/update-security-skills.sh
```

Now you can update with:
```bash
bash scripts/update-security-skills.sh
```

## Workflow Summary

### For package updates:

1. **Edit skills** in package repo (`/secure-claude-skills-package/`)
2. **Commit and push** to GitHub
3. **Update npm** (bump version, `npm publish`)
4. **Pull into main project** via subtree

### For contributing from main project:

1. **Make changes** in main repo (`.claude/skills/security/`)
2. **Push to subtree repo**:
   ```bash
   git subtree push --prefix=.claude/skills/security \
     https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git main
   ```
3. **Update npm** from package repo

### For other users:

```bash
# Install skills in their project
npx secure-claude-skills init --sync subtree

# Later, get updates
npx secure-claude-skills update
```

## Troubleshooting

### npm publish fails with "package already exists"

- Package name is taken
- Use scoped package: `@harperaa/secure-claude-skills`
- Update package.json name and republish

### Subtree conflicts during pull

```bash
# If you get merge conflicts during subtree pull:
git status  # See conflicting files
# Resolve conflicts manually
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve subtree merge conflicts"
```

### Subtree push fails

- Make sure you have push access to the GitHub repo
- Check that remote URL is correct
- Ensure you're on main branch with committed changes

### CLI not working after npm install

```bash
# Verify bin script is executable
chmod +x bin/cli.js

# Test locally
node bin/cli.js --help
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Create GitHub repository
2. âœ… Push package to GitHub
3. âœ… Publish to npm
4. âœ… Set up subtree in main project
5. âœ… Test installation
6. âœ… Update main project documentation
7. ðŸŽ‰ Share with others!

## Publishing Updates (Future)

When you improve skills:

1. **Update skills in either repo**
2. **Sync repos**:
   ```bash
   # From main â†’ package
   git subtree push --prefix=.claude/skills/security \
     https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git main

   # From package â†’ main
   git subtree pull --prefix=.claude/skills/security \
     https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git main --squash
   ```
3. **Bump version** in package.json
4. **Publish to npm**: `npm publish`
5. **Users get updates**: `npx secure-claude-skills update`
