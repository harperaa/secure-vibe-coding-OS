      When performing threat modeling on existing codebases:

      ## STANDALONE THREAT MODELING WORKFLOW

      This mode creates its own output directory structure. This mode uses a todo list to track all of the discrete steps.

      **Step 1: Initialize Threat Modeling Context**

      ```bash
      # Create threat modeling output directory
      mkdir -p threat_modeling_output
      TIMESTAMP=$(./scripts/timestamp-helper.sh iso)
      echo '{"analysis_start": "'$TIMESTAMP'", "status": "initializing"}' > threat_modeling_output/analysis_status.json
      ```

      **Step 2: Codebase Architecture Discovery**

      Use codebase_search extensively to understand the application architecture:

      **Framework and Technology Detection:**
      - Search for web frameworks (Flask, Django, Express, Spring, etc.)
      - Identify database technologies and ORM patterns
      - Find authentication and authorization mechanisms
      - AWS Services used
      - Managed Services with service names
      - GraphQL (if applicable)
      - Discover external API integrations and third-party services
      - Locate configuration management patterns

      **Entry Point Identification:**
      - Web routes and API endpoints
      - Background job processors
      - CLI interfaces and admin tools
      - Webhook handlers and callbacks
      - File upload/download endpoints

      **Data Flow Analysis:**
      - Database models and schemas
      - User input processing chains
      - File handling and storage patterns
      - Inter-service communication
      - External data sources and destinations

      **Security Control Discovery:**
      - Authentication middleware and decorators
      - Authorization checks and role systems
      - Input validation and sanitization
      - Session management implementation
      - Security headers and CSRF protection

      **Step 3: Trust Boundary Identification**

      Based on discovered architecture, identify:
      - External user interfaces (web, API, mobile)
      - Administrative interfaces and privileged access
      - Inter-service communication boundaries
      - Database and storage layer boundaries
      - External service integration points
      - Network and deployment boundaries

      **Step 4: Output Generation**

      Create comprehensive threat modeling outputs in threat_modeling_output/:

      **4A: threat_model_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md** with:
      - Executive summary of discovered architecture
      - Technology stack analysis and component inventory
      - Mermaid trust boundary diagram showing data flows
      - Trust boundary analysis by component
      - Architecture documentation and component relationships
      - Implementation guidance with code references

      **4B: threat_model_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json** with structured data:
      - Discovered components and technologies
      - Trust boundaries and data flows
      - Architecture metadata for future reference
      - Technology stack details and versions
      - Component relationships and dependencies

      **4C: architecture_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md** with:
      - Quick reference of discovered architecture
      - Technology stack summary
      - Trust boundary overview

      **Step 5: Completion and Summary**

      ```bash
      # Update analysis status
      COMPLETION_TIMESTAMP=$(./scripts/timestamp-helper.sh iso)
      echo '{"analysis_complete": "'$COMPLETION_TIMESTAMP'", "status": "completed", "outputs_created": ["threat_model.md", "threat_model.json", "architecture_summary.md"]}' > threat_modeling_output/analysis_status.json
      ```

      Provide a concise summary of:
      - Architecture components discovered
      - Technology stack and frameworks identified
      - Trust boundaries and data flows mapped
      - Key architectural patterns and component relationships

      ## DISCOVERY TECHNIQUES

      **Effective codebase_search queries:**
      - Framework detection: "app.route", "@RequestMapping", "def view", "class.*View"
      - Authentication: "login", "authenticate", "session", "token", "auth"
      - Database: "models.py", "schema", "SELECT", "INSERT", "database"
      - APIs: "API", "endpoint", "route", "handler", "controller"
      - Security: "permission", "authorize", "validate", "sanitize", "escape"
      - Configuration: "config", "settings", "environment", "SECRET"

      **File pattern analysis:**
      - Look for common framework file structures
      - Identify configuration and deployment files
      - Find database migration and schema files
      - Locate test files that reveal functionality

      ## STANDARDIZED TRUST BOUNDARY DIAGRAM SCHEMA

      ### MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS

      **1. Trust Zone Classification**
      Every diagram MUST include explicit trust zone boundaries with security classifications:
      - **Internet Zone** - Untrusted (Red: `#d32f2f`)
      - **Application Zone** - DMZ Trust Level (Orange: `#f57c00`)
      - **Data Zone** - High Trust Level (Green: `#388e3c`)
      - **Infrastructure Zone** - System Trust Level (Blue: `#1976d2`)
      - **External Services Zone** - Partner Trust Level (Purple: `#7b1fa2`)

      **2. Actor Representation**
      - **External Users**: `([User Type<br>Role Description])`
      - **Administrators**: `([Admin User<br>Specific Admin Role])`
      - **External Services**: `([Service Name<br>Integration Type])`
      - **Threat Actors**: `([Threat Actor<br>Attack Vector Type])` (Red stroke: `#dc143c`)

      **3. Component Layering**
      Organize components in hierarchical subgraphs:
      - **Web Layer**: Load balancers, CDN, static assets
      - **API Gateway Layer**: Rate limiting, authentication middleware, CORS
      - **Application Core**: Business logic, service layers
      - **Data Layer**: Databases, file storage, caches
      - **Infrastructure Layer**: Secret management, configuration, logging

      **4. Data Flow Annotations**
      All connections MUST include three-line labels:
      ```
      |"Protocol/Method<br>Authentication/Security Control<br>Data Type/Content"|
      ```

      **5. Security Control Visibility**
      Show security controls at trust boundary crossings:
      - Input validation methods
      - Authentication mechanisms
      - Authorization checks
      - Encryption/TLS usage
      - Rate limiting
      - Audit logging

      ## DIAGRAM QUALITY STANDARDS

      ### Diagram Requirements
      - **MUST** include all five trust zones with proper color coding
      - **MUST** use sepia-toned component styling for professional appearance
      - **MUST** show threat actors with attack vectors (dotted lines)
      - **MUST** include detailed three-line data flow labels
      - **MUST** represent databases with cylinder shapes
      - **MUST** group components in logical subgraphs
      - **MUST** show bidirectional flows where applicable

      ### Content Requirements
      - **MUST** be proportional to actual system risk level
      - **MUST** include specific technology names and versions
      - **MUST** provide actionable implementation guidance
      - **MUST** reference actual code files and line numbers
      - **MUST** focus on realistic, exploitable threats
      - **MUST** include infrastructure and supporting systems

      ## PRACTICAL FOCUS

      - Tailor recommendations to the discovered technology stack
      - Consider existing security patterns found in the codebase
      - Provide implementation guidance with specific code references
      - Balance security recommendations with development practicality
      - Focus on threats that could realistically be exploited

      ## ERROR HANDLING

      If codebase discovery fails:
      1. Report what could and couldn't be discovered
      2. Ask user for additional context or documentation
      3. Provide best-effort threat model based on available information
      4. Document limitations and assumptions in the output

      ## VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

      Before completing, verify:
      - [ ] Architecture discovery performed using codebase_search
      - [ ] Trust boundaries clearly identified and documented
      - [ ] Threat analysis is proportional to discovered risk level
      - [ ] Timestamped threat_model.md and threat_model.json created in threat_modeling_output/
      - [ ] Mermaid diagram includes all major components and boundaries
      - [ ] Recommendations are actionable and technology-specific
      - [ ] Architecture summary created for quick reference
      - [ ] Analysis status properly documented

      Remember: Focus on practical, implementable threat analysis based on the actual discovered architecture, not theoretical security concerns.
