      ## MANDATORY WORKFLOW

      **Step 1: Prepare Environment**

      ```
      # Check if Semgrep is installed
      command -v semgrep || pip install semgrep
      ```

      **Step 2: Automated Vulnerability Scanning (Full Codebase)**

      Run comprehensive Semgrep analysis on the entire codebase:

      ```bash
      # Run comprehensive security scan on the codebase, provide the full folder path. Do not scan . directory.  
      semgrep --config=auto --severity=ERROR --json --output=security_context/semgrep_security.json <full-path-to-repository>

      # Generate dataflow analysis (check if exists first to save time)
      if [ -f "security_context/dataflow_analysis.json" ]; then
        echo "Using existing dataflow analysis"
      else
        echo "Generating dataflow analysis (this may take several minutes)..."
        semgrep --config=auto --severity=ERROR --dataflow-traces --json --output=security_context/dataflow_analysis.json . || echo "Dataflow analysis not available"
      fi
      ```

      **Step 3: Discover Security-Critical Areas for Manual Analysis**

      Use codebase_search to identify key areas for focused manual analysis:
      - API endpoints and web routes
      - Business Logic and Mulwti Step vulnerabilities
      - Authentication and authorization code
      - Input processing and validation
      - Database interaction points
      - File handling operations
      - Configuration management

      Document discovered areas to guide your manual vulnerability discovery efforts.

      **Step 4: Manual Vulnerability Discovery**

      Use your security expertise to identify vulnerabilities that automated tools miss:

      **Business Logic Vulnerabilities:**
      - Authentication bypass opportunities
      - Authorization logic flaws and privilege escalation
      - State management issues and race conditions
      - Workflow bypass vulnerabilities
      - Input validation gaps and business rule violations

      **Framework-Specific Security Issues:**
      - Security middleware misconfigurations
      - Template injection vulnerabilities
      - ORM security issues and query construction flaws
      - Session management vulnerabilities
      - Error handling information disclosure

      **Architecture and Integration Security:**
      - Trust boundary violations
      - API security issues (REST/GraphQL)
      - Third-party integration vulnerabilities
      - Microservice communication security
      - File upload and handling security
      - Cryptographic implementation issues

      **Step 5: Consolidate All Findings**

      Merge automated and manual findings into a single comprehensive dataset:

      Create `security_context/raw_findings.json` with structure:

      ```json
      {
        "automated_findings": {
          "semgrep_security": [...]
        },
        "manual_findings": [
          {
            "id": "MANUAL-001",
            "type": "business_logic",
            "severity": "HIGH",
            "title": "Authentication Bypass in Password Reset",
            "description": "...",
            "location": {"file": "auth.py", "line": 145},
            "vulnerable_code": "...",
            "discovery_method": "manual"
          }
        ],
        "dataflow_available": true/false,
        "scan_coverage": {
          "directories_scanned": [...],
          "total_files_analyzed": 123,
          "frameworks_detected": [...]
        },
        "timestamp": "ISO_TIMESTAMP"
      }
      ```

      **Step 6: Validate and Document Results**

      Ensure all findings are properly documented with:
      - Clear vulnerability descriptions
      - File locations and line numbers
      - Code snippets showing the issue
      - Discovery method (semgrep rule or manual analysis)
      - Initial severity assessment

      **Step 7: Signal Completion**

      ```
      attempt_completion(
        result="Vulnerability scanning completed. Found X automated findings from semgrep --config=auto scan and Y manual findings. Created security_context/raw_findings.json with comprehensive vulnerability data. Dataflow analysis available: [yes/no]. Ready for input source tracing phase."
      )
      ```

      ## ERROR HANDLING

      If scanning fails:
      1. **Report specific failure (semgrep errors, missing directories, etc.)**
      2. **Do NOT create incomplete findings files**
      3. **Provide guidance on resolving scan issues**
      4. **Signal failure via attempt_completion**

      ## VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

      Before completing, verify:
      - [ ] Semgrep --config=auto scan completed successfully
      - [ ] Manual analysis performed across all critical areas
      - [ ] security_context/raw_findings.json created with both automated and manual findings
      - [ ] All findings include required metadata (location, code, severity)
      - [ ] Dataflow analysis attempted (success or failure documented)

      Remember: You must perform BOTH automated scanning AND manual analysis. Don't rely solely on tools - use your security expertise to find issues that automation misses.
