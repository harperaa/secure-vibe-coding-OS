      ## MANDATORY WORKFLOW

      **Step 1: Load All Context Files**

      ```bash
      # Load all analysis results
      cat security_context/config_summary.json
      cat security_context/raw_findings.json
      cat security_context/traced_findings.json
      cat security_context/controls_analysis.json
      cat security_context/adjusted_findings.json

      # Check workflow status
      cat security_context/workflow_status.json
      ```

      **Step 2: Generate Executive Summary**

      Create high-level summary for stakeholders:
      - Total vulnerabilities found by final severity
      - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
      - Overall security posture assessment
      - Key recommendations and next steps

      **Step 3: Create Timestamped Report Files**

      Generate timestamped reports for sharing and archival:

      ```bash
      # Create timestamp for consistent naming
      TIMESTAMP=$(./scripts/timestamp-helper.sh filename)
      REPORT_DIR="security_reports"
      mkdir -p "$REPORT_DIR"

      # Create main report with timestamp
      cp security_context/final_report.md "$REPORT_DIR/security_assessment_$TIMESTAMP.md"

      # Create executive summary
      cp security_context/quick_reference.md "$REPORT_DIR/executive_summary_$TIMESTAMP.md"

      # Create metrics file
      cp security_context/metrics.json "$REPORT_DIR/metrics_$TIMESTAMP.json"

      # Create shareable findings export
      jq '.adjusted_findings[] | select(.final_classification.severity == "CRITICAL" or .final_classification.severity == "HIGH")' security_context/adjusted_findings.json > "$REPORT_DIR/priority_findings_$TIMESTAMP.json"
      ```

      Generate comprehensive technical documentation in `security_context/final_report.md`:

      # Security Assessment Methodology

      Our security assessment process combines automated vulnerability discovery with expert manual analysis to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and filter out false positives.

      ## Assessment Process

      **Architecture Discovery & Threat Modeling**
      We begin by mapping the application architecture, identifying entry points, trust boundaries, and data flows. This includes analyzing the technology stack (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.) and understanding attack surfaces before testing begins.

      **Automated Vulnerability Discovery**
      We use Semgrep static analysis with custom security rules to systematically scan for known vulnerability patterns. This covers the OWASP Top 10 including injection flaws, authentication failures, and integrity issues, plus framework-specific vulnerabilities in technologies like FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. The automated phase efficiently identifies common security issues like SQL injection, insecure deserialization, and path traversal vulnerabilities.

      **Expert Manual Analysis**
      Manual security review focuses on vulnerabilities that automated tools miss. Our security engineers analyze business logic flaws, authentication bypass scenarios, and authorization logic that could lead to privilege escalation. This includes deep framework-specific analysis, plus building complex multi-step attack chains that require contextual understanding.

      ## Input Source Tracing

      A key differentiator is tracing every vulnerability back to its input source to determine actual exploitability:

      - **üî¥ External Untrusted** (HTTP params, file uploads, API payloads and things fully controled by users) - Full severity
      - **üü° Semi-Trusted** (config files, environment variables) - 80% severity
      - **üü¢ Application Controlled** (internal IDs, computed values) - 50% severity
      - **‚ö™ System Controlled** (hardcoded constants, framework internals) - 10% severity

      This classification system helps filter false positives.

      ## Security Controls Analysis

      We analyze existing security controls around each vulnerability to understand the complete security posture:

      **Control Discovery & Assessment**
      Our security controls analysis identifies and evaluates existing defensive measures including authentication systems, authorization checks, input validation frameworks, rate limiting, encryption implementations, and monitoring/logging systems. We assess each control's implementation quality, coverage completeness, bypass resistance, and integration effectiveness using a comprehensive scoring methodology.

      **Defense-in-Depth Evaluation**
      We evaluate security layers across network security, application security, data security, identity security, and monitoring security controls. This analysis provides context for why certain vulnerabilities may have reduced risk due to complementary security measures, even when the vulnerable code itself lacks direct protection.

      **Control Effectiveness Scoring**
      Each security control receives an effectiveness score based on implementation quality (30%), coverage completeness (25%), bypass resistance (25%), and integration quality (20%). This scoring helps determine how much existing controls reduce the actual risk of vulnerabilities.
      
      ## Enhanced Risk-Based Severity Adjustment
      
      We adjust vulnerability severity based on both input source controllability AND existing security controls effectiveness. A critical SQL injection vulnerability may be reduced in severity if it's protected by strong authentication controls and comprehensive input validation, even when reachable from external sources. Our enhanced severity adjustment matrix considers input controllability, security controls effectiveness, and defense-in-depth layers to provide realistic risk assessments that reflect the actual security posture rather than just theoretical vulnerability patterns.


      ## Validation & Remediation

      **Proof-of-Concept Development**
      For critical and high-severity findings, we develop working exploit code with step-by-step attack instructions including all prerequisites. This includes building multi-step attack scenarios that demonstrate the full impact potential, from initial access through privilege escalation or data exfiltration.

      **Remediation Guidance**
      Each fix recommendation comes with a confidence score indicating implementation complexity. High confidence fixes (90-100%) are simple changes with no breaking impact, medium confidence (70-89%) require coordination and testing, while low confidence fixes (50-69%) need careful planning due to their complexity.

      ## Quality Assurance

      - Cross-validation of automated findings through manual analysis
      - False positive filtering based on input source traceability
      - Coverage metrics across analyzed files and frameworks
      - Severity validation against actual exploitability

      The methodology prioritizes actionable findings over theoretical vulnerabilities, focusing resources on issues that pose real security risks.
