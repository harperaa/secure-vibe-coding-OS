## Workflow Examples

### Workflow 1: Adding a Contact Form

1. Open `built-in-controls/01_contact_form.md`
2. Copy the prompt
3. Customize: app name, fields, rate limits
4. Give to Claude Code
5. Test: CSRF, rate limiting, XSS prevention
6. Update threat model: `threat-modeling/08_update_model.md`

**Time**: 30 minutes

---

### Workflow 2: Adding Admin Dashboard

1. Check if RBAC exists, if not use `auth-authorization/01_rbac_implementation.md`
2. Use `prompt-engineering/04_admin_action.md` for each admin feature
3. Test with `prompt-engineering/08_security_testing.md`
4. Review code with `threat-modeling/04_code_review.md`
5. Update threat model

**Time**: 2-3 hours

---

### Workflow 3: Starting New Project

**Week 1: Architecture**
1. Design security architecture (Module 2.6)
2. Create threat model: `threat-modeling/01_stride_analysis.md`
3. Set up RBAC: `auth-authorization/01_rbac_implementation.md`

**Week 2-4: Implementation**
4. Use feature prompts as you build
5. Update threat model after each feature
6. Run security tests before each deploy

**Week 5: Launch Prep**
7. Complete security review: `threat-modeling/04_code_review.md`
8. Run comprehensive tests: `prompt-engineering/08_security_testing.md`
9. Final threat model review

## Tips for Using This Library

### 1. Always Customize

Don't use prompts verbatim. Replace:
- `[PROJECT_NAME]` with your app name
- `[FEATURE_NAME]` with your specific feature
- Rate limits with your requirements
- Validation rules with your constraints

### 2. Reference Your Architecture

Always include in your prompt:
```
Reference: @docs/security/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md
```

This helps Claude understand your specific setup.

### 3. Combine Prompts

Many features need multiple prompts:
- Authentication + Ownership + Validation
- RBAC + Permissions + Admin Actions
- Implementation + Testing + Threat Model Update

### 4. Test Every Time

After using a prompt:
1. Use the testing checklist in the prompt file
2. Run `prompt-engineering/08_security_testing.md`
3. Verify all security controls work

### 5. Keep Threat Model Current

After every feature:
- Use `threat-modeling/08_update_model.md`
- Update your `docs/security/THREAT_MODEL.md`
- Version your threat model (v1.0, v1.1, v1.2...)

---

## Maintaining This Library

### Adding New Prompts

Add a prompt when you:
- Solve a security problem not covered here
- Find a better implementation pattern
- Learn from a security bug
- Discover a new attack vector

Use the standard format above.

### Versioning Prompts

Track changes in each prompt's Version History section:

```markdown
## Version History

**v1.1** (2025-11-15): Added file size validation
**v1.0** (2025-10-21): Initial version
```

### Sharing with Teams

1. Store in Git repository
2. Use pull requests for changes
3. Review before merging
4. Keep README updated
